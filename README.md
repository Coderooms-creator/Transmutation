Introducing Transmute: The Ultimate Tool for Password Cracking Dictionary Enhancement! 🔥

Is your password cracking dictionary lacking creativity? You might have every word in the English language, but what if your target has outsmarted you by adding a symbol or number at the end of a common word? Or even worse, what if they've replaced a letter with a symbol? 🧐

Your dictionary won’t be able to handle those clever variations, and that’s where Transmute comes in! With this powerful tool, you can boost your password cracking dictionaries with controlled complexity. 🎯

Unlock the potential to generate countless variations of words, adding that extra "salt" to your dictionary so you're prepared for even the most creative passwords. 💥


To apply the **Common Leet** transformation to the words in `input.txt` and save the results to `final.txt`, run the following command:
